# 🧮 Calculator Project – Python (Shared)

👥 Shared with ALI CS Club

---

This is the **shared Python calculator repository** for ALI CS Club members.  
It contains two types of calculators:
- `cli/` – A terminal-based calculator using basic input/output.
- `gui/` – A graphical calculator built with Tkinter for a more visual, button-driven interface.

Each version is kept in its own folder and has its own main Python script.

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines

- If you're working **independently**, please **fork** this repo or create a new **branch**, and submit a **pull request** when your work is ready to merge.
- If you're working **together with a club member** (e.g., in a meeting), only **one person should edit and push at a time** to avoid conflicts.
- Keep code clean, well-documented, and placed in the appropriate folder (`cli/` or `gui/`).

- Core programming concepts like logic flow, conditionals, and functions (CLI version).
- User interface design and event-driven programming (GUI version).
- Git/GitHub collaboration best practices.

Happy coding!
